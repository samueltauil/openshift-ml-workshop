# OpenShift ML Workshop

This workshop is focused in showing the workflow of machine learning development on OpenShift. 

It uses the content created by [@sophwats](https://github.com/sophwats), [@willb](https://github.com/willb) and [@mbogoevici](https://github.com/mbogoevici) 
and here we are building upon to create a gitops approach using the Openshift GitOps Operator.

This repo also uses the ansible-runner manifests and image that was created by [@nasx](https://github.com/nasx).
